<h2 class="3.1-ReviewthebenefitsanddrawbacksofITtoolsandsystemsusedintermsofproductivityandefficiency">3.1 - Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>The benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency have
their benefits like using slack which allows you to share your work when working on a project in teams it
reduces the number of meetings and calls allowing you to focus more on the project and its content. Trello
keeps you on track in terms of what needs to be and what has been so you are less confused.
<br>
<br>
The drawback I have faced in creating my website is not planning it out properly, the content, theme, being
 more effecient with time therefore not having enough time working on the layout of my website.</p>
<h2 class="3.2-Describewaystoimproveproductivityandefficiency">3.2 - Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>To improve productivity and efficiency it is important that core tasks in teams are done by reducing
the amount of time travelling to and from meetings but instead using more effecient ways to stay on track.
Using tools like Zoom, slack and trello are more productive, easy and time efficient as you can get all
the information at the click of a button therefore having more time to concentrate on the project, completing
the task on time.</p>
<h2 class="3.3-DevelopsolutionstoimproveownproductivityusingITindigitalprojects">3.3 - Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
<p>To improve own productivity using IT in digital projects I would work as a team beacuse you would be
able to help each other out if something goes wrong in the project. Using Trello and Slack with team mates
would be effecient and productive beacuse you can share the workload evenly between each other which saves you
time and keeps you focused to complete the task assigned to you, whether it be the layout, wriiten work or design
you would feel less pressure, than having to do it on your own not having a clue where to start.</p>
<h2 class="3.4-Describehowyouwouldgoabouttestingdigitalsolutions">3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
<p>The way i would go about testing digital solutions is that i would have other team members test the
final product. Having external users testing the project would be beneficial because it would be seen with a fresh
pair of eyes and they would probably interact with it differently and give you different solutions and
constructive criticism on how to improve your project to make run more smoothly or for it look better. Agile or DevOps
are testing methods too as it provides a outline for the testers to follow. The more methods and people you
have to test your project the better outcome you will get to improve your project.</p>
