<br>
<p>Hi my name is Sofia Abbas. Welcome to my page. I am 35 years of age, I have been married for 13 years.
I have a son who is 12. I have a BA (Hons) in Community Studies and I am a proud house wife who has recently developed an interest in Coding.
At the moment I am learning to code with Code Nation, learning CSS, HTML, and Python. The reason for choosing this path was
was simple to expand my knowledge and maybe one day create my own Website based around baking or makeup which I enjoy doing in my spare time.
<br>
<br>
I have had a few jobs in retail and takeaways, nothing major so, I thought why not try this? I have no experience in Coding
and honestly speaking I have enjoyed it. I have made some lovely friends along the way and also the thought of having 
my own Website or creating one for someone really excites me. Maybe this will be my Career, who knows?</p>
