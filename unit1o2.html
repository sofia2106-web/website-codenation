<h2 class="2.1-ReviewtheongoinguseofITtoolsandchangeapproachasneeded">2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h2>
<p>I used Visual Studio for all my coding whether it was creating a game using Python or using it
for HTML and CSS for creating my Website. VS is very useful, fun to use and more friendly in terms
of writing code, creating shorcuts, speeds up coding and you make less mistakes when typing.
<br>
<br>
Using trello was amazing because I was able to keep track of my progress whether it was for a team
project or for individual use like creating my website. Being able to add notes even minor ones just helps you
remember what needs to done. Overall i was happy with the tools i used. The website i used to help me write codes
and have a better understanding was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>"</p>
<h2 class="2.2-describewhethertheittoolsselectedwereappropriate">2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
<p>The tools I used VS code and Trello were very appropriate for me. For someone like me who has never
done coding before or ever heard of it even Trello I would say these tools are user friendly and easy to
to use once you get your head around it. Trello helped me stay focused in check at all times helped me plan out 
my pages and execute them nicely.
<br>
<br>
VS Code is brilliant for coding styling your pages adding pictures, creating shorcuts to speed up coding whether
it is in HTML or CSS. you can get very creative with it and also picks up your mistakes so you can fix them. For
me personally I think using these tools was appropriate.</p>
<h2 class="2.3-Assessthestrengthsandweaknessesofyourfinalproject">2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
<p>Doing a website project for the first time is not as easy, alot of thought and planning goes into it.
Overall I think my website looks decent, looks approachable. The strength of my website is its readable, its
bold the layout looks decent. Weaknesses to my website is it looks basic maybe not enough coding has been used to
make it look better, such as having a different background for different pages, I mean if my website was to run
it would give me a better idea of what people think, people with disabilities can they read it? Are the colors
too bright? and the list could go on, but overall making a website for the first time I am happy with it.</p>
<h2 class="2.4-Describefurtherimprovementsyoucanmaketoyourproject">2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
<p>The improvements I would make to my project would be to make it accessible and user friendly for people
with disabilities and for those who suffer from color blindness by not using harsh colors or using voice
animation for people who have hearing problems. I would make it more interactive by using different techniques
such as using different styles of fonts add more images use different borders. I would definetly do more reseach
to improve my project.</p>
<h2 class="2.5-Reviewoutcomestomakesuretheymatchrequirementsandarefitforpurpose">2.5 - Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
<p>To make sure my website runs smoothly I made sure that the coding was correct whether it was HTML or CSS
remember to save and would then refresh the page and see if it worked. I also made adjustments to my background
so it didn't look too harsh and fitted on the page and blended well with my paragraphs. I carefully considered
how my pages would look and made sure they looked the same, obviously with different content. After trials and errors
my website turned out the way I wanted it to be.</p>
