<h2 class="1.1-Describingthecontentandlayoutforeachpage">1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
<p>The websites I have created has the following pages:
<br>
<br>
Home and welcome page - Showing the navigation bar that you can click to navigate to the other pages.
<br>
Unit one outcome 1 - Has the questions and answers that is related to this course.
<br>
Unit one outcome 2 - Has the questions and answers that is related to this course.
<br>
Unit one outcome 3 - Has the questions and answers that is related to this course.
<br>
Unit two outcome 1 - Has the questions and answers that is related to this course.
<br>
About me page - This page cotains a picture of me, my contact information and details about myself.
<br>
<br>
The layout of my theme is simple, each page has got the same background. I kept it simple so if people were to go on
to my website page they wouldn't feel overwhelmed or confused what to look at first (less is more). Maybe when I am
more confident in coding I will create a more complex website.</p>
<h2 class="1.5-Describingcopyrightandotherconstraintsaffectingwebsites">1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
<p>When creating a website one should be aware of all the legal requirements they would need in order
to use or upload on to their page, such as permission, license or copywright. By not having this knowledge or failing
to copmly with these reqiurements could end up costing the person a fine or shutting the website down. Such as if
you have uploaded a music video without having the owners permission leagally you would have to take it down. Also
when using images or content one should always check that the content is accurate as it could be misleading and cause
issues for your website like bad reviews or facing leagal charges. For more information. <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/website-permissions/websites/">fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/website-permissions/websites/!</a></p>
<h2 class="1.6-Describingaccessissuesthatneedtakingintoaccount">1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>
<p>Issues that would need taking into account especially for people who have disabilities and the type
of disabilty they would have such as some could have hearing impairment, some could be color blind
or some could be visually impaired. As a web designer I would have to take this in to consideration and see how I can
make this website user friendly whether you do or dont have a disabilty. Such as a person who is color blind may
benefit from different color schemes. Visually impaired people would benefit from audio descriptions. Therefore I
design this website so it would be tailor made to everyone's liking.</p>
<h2 class="1.7-Describewhicharetheappropriatefiletypesforwebsites">1-7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>
<p> The appropriate file types to use for websites would be the following whether it is uploading images, videos or music.
I used images so the file-type I used for my About me page and the background of my website was PNG and JPG.
<br>
<br>
JPEG: One of the most common one to use, because the format is user friendly for all types of photographs.
<br>
PNG: If you take a lot of screenshots, this format is perfect to use and for other images that dont't contain a lot of color.
<br>
GIF: This format is for those who have a lot of animated graphics, because it gives people a chance to show their
artistic side on their site.
<br>
JPG: This is a digital image format, thats contains compressed image data. This format is mainly used for sharing
photos and other images on the internet.
<br>
<br>
Every file-type is different, depending what you are uploading, such as for uplaoding videos the file types would
be Webm, flv, mov, qt and much more and for audio you have wav, mp3, aac and so on. For more information.
