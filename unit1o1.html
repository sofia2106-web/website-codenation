<h2 class="1.4-Describetherisksthatmightimpactdigitalprojects">1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
<p>Being in modern society where technology is life, it is quite scary to think that we cannot live without it.
We are so dependant on our gadgets that we feel lost without it or we have no purpose in our life (like life never existed befrore technology!).
So, what could go wrong? A lot could go wrong when making didgital projects causing them to fail, such as holding a meeting
via zoom call because of Covid-19 you can not meet in person this is one way to communicate, it's all good until the power
goes, or you lose WiFi connection, the internet failing, no good reception.
<br>
<br>
Another reason for digital projects to fail would be not saving your work this could be due to your laptop/computer crashing and shuts down, which would mean you would
probably start again which would probably lead to you having a mental breakdown. These are some of the factors that could 
lead to digital projects failing, which would eventually lead to handwritten work which existed once upon a time.</p>
<h2 class="1-5describehowyouwouldgoaboutselectingandusingitsystemsandsoftware">1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
<p>The first step when choosing the right software tools for your business is in fact having the knwledge of what you
want the software to do, beacuse without having the knowledge you willnot know what you are looking for. It is always
good to know the procedure as in what are you aiming for the software to do? Establish the pain points, meaning how
will the software solve new solutions and problems. It is also good to know the value of the software such as the worth,
are you able to calculate the strategic benefits, time savings or the cost savings of the new system? so
having the right knowledge and software would benefit your project a lot. For more information.
<br>
<br>
There are many other factors to take into consideration, such as if you are working on a project and you need
to be in a meeting, having a laptop would be more useful than a desktop beacuse laptops are portable you can
carry on with your project whhilst on your journey for meeting and with cloud storage you are able to work
anywhere whether its making lists on your phone or coding on your laptop.

<h2 class="1.6-describeandprovideanalysisonhowyourchosentechnologieshavehelpedyouachieveyouroutcomes">1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>
<p>The chosen technologies that have helped acheive my outcome have been very useful. Such as using trello
has really help me because it has allowed me to stay focused and keep all my work in order from to do, to doing, to
done at the click of a button. GitHub which is an online portfolio has been really useful because it allows me
and other users to upload their digital projects and codes. This has been very useful because GitHub is able to make
multiple amendments at one time because GitHub is able to identify and and make changes automatically and accordingly.
Therefore the most current version is always available. GitHub always informs the user to add a commit message whenever
an upload is made so that it allows anyone that looks at the project can also see the changes that have been made.

<h2 class="1.7-Describelegalguidelinesandconstraintsthatimpactdigitalprojects">1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation 14 April 2016 (GDPR) is a legal framework that protects data and private
information, meaning that all software should be written to comply with local and global requirements. This means that
all codes should be written to secure private or senetive information, whether it be credit card details, home adress,
phone numbers, bank details and so on. Companies have had to therefore update their policies to make sure that they
the GDPR requirements so customers are assured that their information is secure and is updated or taken off if there 
is a time limit on.
<br>
<br>
Failing to follow these guidelines can cause seriuos problems and get a lot of compnaies into trouble if
customers private information is leaked which could potentially end up in anyone's hand for misuse causeing the
customer and the company a lot of serious damage and fraud. This would leave a bad impression on companies, negative
feedbacks causing companies huge losses and huge fines. Not keeping within the guidelines impacts digital
projects as it could affect their future developments and maintenance.
